# Jacob Venable's Portfolio

This repository is used to manage my personal web portfolio:

[jacobvenable.com](https://www.jacobvenable.com/)

I want to give a special thank you to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), who provides building and hosting for the project ðŸŽ‰.

The project itself is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

## Installation

_Note: This repository does also contain images for the sake of simple Netlify deployment. If you clone the repository, you will get these images as well._

If you want to mess around with the site yourself, please feel free to clone the project and follow the installation directions below.

_NOTE: You may **NOT** use my site as a skeleton to build your own. Sorry, I get possessive like that._ ðŸ˜‰

Next, within the repo directory, locally install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

Then you can run the site on a local server with:

```sh
yarn dev
```

For information on NextJS and its patterns, see the [NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
