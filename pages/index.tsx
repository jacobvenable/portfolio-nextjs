                  In my current role as a senior front-end developer for Purdue
                  Marketing and Media, I have a wide range of duties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    create sites based on mockups provided by UX/UI designers
                    (HTML, CSS, and JS)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    setup sites within the university&apos;s content management
                    system (Cascade Server)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    train end-users in using the content management system
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    setup and improve the team&apos;s development workflows and
                    standards
                  </li>
                  <li>guide other web developers on the team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In the end, I like to think of myself a problem-solver. If
                  something doesn&apos;t work well or efficiently, I like to
                  find out how to make it better, and it shows with the changes
                  I&apos;ve made while at Purdue:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    implemented Gulp.js to automate the development workflow
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    added SCSS to our toolkit to improve styles management
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    created reusable patterns using BEM CSS class structuring
                    reducing CSS specificity to 1 - 2 levels
                  </li>
                  <li>improved JS bundling to decrease page load times</li>
                  <li>
                    instituted and documented the development teamâ€™s Git
                    branching model creating uniformity and accountability
                    through code reviews
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    developed an automatic, custom SVG parser within our CMS to
                    eliminate developer intervention when implementing inline
                    SVGs
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    initiated and developed an improved UI within our content
                    management system
                  </li>

                    className="accordion__icon"

                <p>
                  Since my first programming class in high school, I&apos;ve
                  known that I&apos;ve wanted to have a career in development.
                  To move in that direction, I applied to and was accepted into
                  Purdue University&apos;s Computer Science program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a year in the program I learned there was a caveat to my
                  career choice; it needed to be visually-rewarding. While the
                  Computer Science program gave me a great foundation, I felt I
                  was missing out on applying it. I looked around for something
                  a bit more practical and decided to take an introduction to
                  web development, which was part of the Computer Graphics
                  Technology (CGT) program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Long story short, I fell in love with web development,
                  switched to the CGT program, and the rest is history.

                  During my time at Purdue, I was exposed to and practiced
                  various skillsets involved with creating a final product for
                  the web:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>UI/UX research and design</li>
                  <li>front-end development</li>
                  <li>back-end development</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  While each of these skillsets have some overlap and are
                  interesting in their own way, front-end development was where
                  I found a home. It is the perfect combination of{" "}
                  <mark>creativity</mark> and <mark>logic</mark> while also
                  having a <mark>visually-rewarding</mark> product as the
                  end-result.

                  Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or a hundred

                  I would definitely fight a horse-sized duck. Battling a
